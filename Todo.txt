	*Pieces ALWAYS fall down
	*You can swap the position of two pieces, that are next to each other horizontally
	*You may also swap a piece with an empty horizontal space to move the piece
	*When a piece is moved or swapped a new piece is spawned at a random position at the top
	*When two pieces of the same value are stacked, they combine into a piece with a higher value, giving you points
	*When the board is full, you lose the game
	*As the game progresses, the range of pieces that can drop will increase
